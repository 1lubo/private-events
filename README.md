## What's this

A project completed as part of [The Odin Ruby on Rails Learning Track](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events) to dive into ActiveRecordâ€™s associations. The project involves building a private website with similar functionality to the well known event organization and management platform [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/).

**HEADS UP:** Heroku server may need up to 30 sec to fire up a dyno. Be patient! :)
You can use 'Mr. Orange', 'Mr. Blonde', 'Mr. Pink', 'Mr. White' or 'Mr. Brown' as test users to see full functionality.
